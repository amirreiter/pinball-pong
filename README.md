# Pin-ball Pong

This is my submission for CMPTGCS 20C Project 1.

### Build instructions

1. Install dependencies with your favorite package manager:
`bun i` or `npm install`

2. Run the project locally with your favorite JS runtime:
`bun run dev` or `node run dev`

3. (Optionally) if you want to deploy to some static webserver run: `bun run build` or `node run build` to build the project at the `/docs` directory. Github pages can then be configured with `/docs` as the root directory. The Github pages build will *not* work unless the repository is called `pinball-pong`.
